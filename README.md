A tool to let human play game against AI model.

Today there are quite many python RL(reinforcement learning) models that can play arcade game, e.g. stree fighter. Models are trained in an internal environemnt, such as gym-retro environment, and it is not interactable (you cannot interact with the envrionment via your mouse or keyboard), which means human cannot play with/against the model you trained.
It will be intersting and exciting that human can play with/against the model you trained, that's why I invented this library and share it with you guys.
